= Command Line Interface Shell for Anypoint Platform.
:keywords: administration, api, organization, users, gateway, theme, cli

Anypoint Platform provides you a command line tool to interact with your applications through both interactive shell and standard CLI modes.

== Assumptions

This document assumes that you are familiar with our link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/anypoint-platform-for-apis-walkthrough[Anypoint platform for APIs walkthrough] and that you are able to link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/managing-your-api[manage your API using Anypoint Platform].

////
== Installation

[IMPORTANT]
First you need to make sure you have the node.js runtime environment installed in your machine. Along with it, you'll need to use node's default package manager (npm) to be able to install Anypoint-CLI.
Following the steps in the link:https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node[node documentation] will help you get both resources.

You can install Anypoint-CLI using node's default package manager by typing in your console

[source,bash]
----
$ npm install -g anypoint-cli
----
////

== Usage
Every instance of Anypoint-CLI takes any of the following parameters:

[width="100a",cols="33a,33a,33a",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter |Description| Required
|username | Your Anypoint Platform username. +
You can also use an environment variable (e.g. `export ANYPOINT_USERNAME=<name>`)| *Yes*
|password | Your Anypoint Platform password. +
You can also use an environment variable (e.g. `export ANYPOINT_PASSWORD=<pwd>`)| *Yes*
|organization| Your organization within Anypoint Platform. +
You can also use an environment variable (e.g. `export ANYPOINT_ORG=<name>`)| No
|environment| Your Anypoint-CLI environment. +
You can also use an environment variable (e.g. `export ANYPOINT_ENV=<name>`)| No
|===

[IMPORTANT]
--
A few considerations to keep in mind while using Anypoint-CLI:

. As instructed above, the username and password parameters are required. If you don't pass them, Anypoint-CLI will not run. For security reasons we strongly recommend to pass both parameters as environment variables, such as the example above `$ANYPOINT_USERNAME` and `$ANYPOINT_PASSWORD` +
. If you don't set an environment, you will be automatically sent to `production`. +
. Your Anypoint session won't expire if you are accessing through this command line interface. +
. Anypoint-CLI works with autocomplete. You can start typing the name of the command or parameter and hit `tab` for an autocomplete, or double tap `tab` for a list of all possible options.
--

Once you have your parameters in order, you can pass commands. +
A list of available commands is below:

[width="100a",cols="50a,50a",options="header"]

An Anypoint-CLI call should then have the following form:
[source,bash]
----
$ anypoint-cli [params] [command]
----

If you choose not to pass a command, Anypoint-CLI will run in *interactive mode*.
If you choose to pass a specific command and there is an error, the application will exit and return you a description of the issue.
