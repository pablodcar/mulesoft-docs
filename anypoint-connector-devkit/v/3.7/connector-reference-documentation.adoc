This document describes what to include in your connector source files and how to generate its documentation.

toc::[]

== Introduction

After you build your connector, document its functionality to help customers use it effectively and reduce customer support and training costs.

Connector documentation usually consists of:

* Javadoc reference documentation (see improved Javadoc generation workflow in <<Generating Documentation, Generating Documentation>>)
* README
* Release notes
* User guide
* Use cases - for examples see link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.7/packaging-your-connector-for-release#documenting-with-use-cases[Documenting with Use Cases]

Mule builds on link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc[Javadoc] to automate and simplify the creation of technical reference documentation for your connector, by adding a custom Javadoc Doclet and some DevKit-specific Java annotations.
//TODO: could this paragraph be written more clearer, in particular i don't like "by adding a custom...". This is "legacy" text. How does the doclet work? Do we need to mention it?

== Prerequisites

This document assumes you are familiar with Anypoint Studio and Javadoc. It also assumes that you have already developed and tested your connectors.

== Annotations for Generating Documentation

The following sections describe the Java annotations that can be used to generate the documentation for your connector built using Anypoint DevKit.

[NOTE]
Documentation is not mandatory, however, unless you disable the Javadoc Check, errors display. To disable Javadoc Check and show errors as warnings, right-click your project, and click *Anypoint Connector* > *Disable Javadoc check*.

=== Required Connector Metadata: @Connector and @Author

Each class annotated with `@Connector` should have a class-level Javadoc comment with a high-level overview of the extensions. This may also include the `@author` annotation.

[source, java, linenums]
----
/**
 * MongoDB is an open source, high-performance, schema-free, document-oriented database that manages collections of BSON documents.
 *
 * @author Mulesoft
 * @javadoc.url org.bson[https://api.mongodb.org/java/3.1/];
 * @javadoc.url com.mongodb[https://api.mongodb.org/java/3.1/];
 */
@Connector(name = "mongo", schemaVersion = "2.0", friendlyName = "Mongo DB", minMuleVersion = "3.6")
@ReconnectOn(exceptions = IllegalStateException.class)
@RequiresEnterpriseLicense
public class MongoCloudConnector {
...
----

=== Documenting @Configurable Attributes

`@Configurable` annotations can be documented by having a Javadoc comment that briefly explains the attribute.

[source, java, linenums]
----
/**
 * The username to access the service
 */
 @Configurable
 private String username;

/**
 * The password to access the service
 */
 @Configurable
 private String password;

/**
 * The API endpoint;
 */
 @Configurable
 private String apiEndpoint;
----

=== Documenting @Processor Methods and Parameters

Each method annotated with @Processor or @Source (for streaming APIs) should have a Javadoc comment that includes the following:

* A description of the use of the method
* A pointer to an XML code sample for the element in Mule (described below)
* For each parameter of the method, a Javadoc `@param` annotation, with a description of the parameter

If the method has a return type other than `void`, a Javadoc `@return` annotation includes a description of the return value.

[source, java, linenums]
----
/**
 * Inserts a document in a collection, setting its id if necessary.
 *
 *
 * @param collection
 *            the name of the collection where to insert the given document.
 * @param document
 *            a {@link Document} instance.
 * @return the id that was just inserted
 */
@Processor
public String insertDocument(final String collection, @RefOnly @Default("#[payload]") final Document document) {
    Validate.notNull(collection);
    Validate.notNull(document);
    return config.getClient().insertObject(collection, document);
}
----
=== Annotation for Non-Java Data Types

To embed a link in your documentation to external Javadoc reference material, it is recommended to use a placeholder within your code comments in the format `{@link NonJavaDataType}`.
//is it the @link annotation that generates a link to the mongodb reference, e.g. for the MongoDB datatype Document??

[source,java,linenums]
----
* @param collection
*            the name of the collection where to insert the given document.
* @param document
*            a {@link Document} instance.
* @return the id that was just inserted
*/
----

The base URL to the reference material for a data type must be created by annotating the *connector class* with the Javadoc tag `@javadoc.url`.

* Then add a space, and enter the name of the Java package, for example, `org.bson`.
* Finally, put the Java extension's URL between brackets *[ ]*. This URL *must* be a Javadoc URL. See the following example:

[source,java,linenums]
----
/**
* @javadoc.url org.bson[https://api.mongodb.org/java/3.1/];
* @javadoc.url com.mongodb[https://api.mongodb.org/java/3.1/];
*/
public class MongoCloudConnector {
----

DevKit concatenates the base URL for the MongoDB Java API, and the paths to the particular package, and the specific class

image:apidoc-mongo-document-attr.png[apidoc-mongo-document-attr]

Clicking *Document* above would direct you to `https://api.mongodb.org/java/3.1/org/bson/Document.html`, as seen here:

image:mongo-document-ref.png[mongo-document-ref]

//TODO: Please confirm, whole section below can be deleted since all that is needed is the `xml.sample` file in the connector's `doc` folder.
////
=== Required XML Code Samples: @sample.xml

The `@sample.xml` annotation points to an XML snippet that demonstrates how to use this method in Anypoint Studio XML configuration. This example is then featured in the generated DevKit documentation.

DevKit also performs sanity checks on the XML code referenced by the `@sample.xml` annotation, ensuring that the XML example parses successfully against the generated schema for your connector.

Syntax for the annotation is shown in the example below.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
{@sample.xml xml-location tag-name}
----

The parameters passed to `@sample.xml` are as follows:

* `xml-location`: The relative path from `src/main/java` to the example file. The Maven archetype creates this file in your project at `doc/project-name.xml.sample`; the relative path is generally  `../../../`
* `tag-name`: A name for the example in the `.xml.sample` file, in the format `myconnector:my-method-name` or `myconnector:myMethodName`.
////

=== XML Code Samples File

The examples file must adhere to the structure displayed in the example below:

* `BEGIN_INCLUDE`
* inside parentheses the name of the module followed by a colon `:`,
* then the name of the operation.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<!-- BEGIN_INCLUDE(myconnector:method-a) -->
// example here
<!-- END_INCLUDE(myconnector:method-a) -->
<!-- BEGIN_INCLUDE(myconnector:method-b) -->
// example here
<!-- END_INCLUDE(myconnector:method-b) -->
...
----

Here is an example code snippet for the message processor `createFileFromPayload` given above.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<!-- BEGIN_INCLUDE(mongo:create-file-from-payload) -->
        <mongo:create-file-from-payload config-ref="Mongo_DB__Configuration" filename="#[variable:filename]" metadata-ref="myDbObject"/>
<!-- END_INCLUDE(mongo:create-file-from-payload) -->
----

Devkit can find a second example that uses the same operation as long as it is tagged using the structure above.

== Generating Documentation

Documentation can be previewed by right-clicking your project in the Package Explorer, then selecting *Anypoint Connector* > *Preview Documentation*.

[IMPORTANT]
You must have *DevKit 3.8* and have *Java SDK 7 or higher* enabled to access the updated documentation features described here. Ensure the appropriate versions of DevKit and Java SDK are specified in your `pom.xml` file.

When you generate documentation for your connector (*Project* > *Generate Javadoc*), DevKit automatically creates both an *HTML* file and an link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/#what-is-asciidoc[AsciiDoc] file that serve as a user-friendly reference for the Java comments you have added within your code explaining connector methods and attributes.

//TODO: Juani/Paulo, please confirm/adjust wording above to detail the basic process of how users generate docs and whether connector build process will create docs automatically

Alternatively, you can navigate to the connector's root directory and execute the following Maven command to generate the documentation:

----
mvn clean compile -Dgenerate.apidocs
----

The generated documentation can be found in the `target/apidocs` directory in your connector folder. Open the file `connectorname-apidoc.html` to show the fully generated documentation in the browser.

image:devkit-doc-screenshot.png[devkit-doc-screenshot]

The documentation always includes the following:

* Mule XML configuration documentation
* Reference documentation for calling connector methods directly from Java
* A (boilerplate) guide to installing the connector in Mule
//TODO: there is no install guide in the apidoc as far as I can tell. Will it be included in the final version?

[NOTE]
If you want URLs inside your Javadoc comments to be parsed as hyperlinks, wrap them in HTML tags, that is, `<a href>URL</a>`.
//TODO: Juani, could you confirm this is what you were explaining to me? Adjust as necessary.

As you build out your connector, perform a review of the generated documentation to ensure that the contents are sane and correct. If you find the generated documentation insufficient, you can always include more detail in the Java comments in your code.
//TODO: is it accurate to call them Java comments, or better Javadoc comments?
