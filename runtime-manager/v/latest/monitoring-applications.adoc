After you deploy an application, either to CloudHub or your own servers, you can use the Runtime Manager to monitor its performance.

Depending on if your application is deployed to link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-cloudhub[CloudHub] or to link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-your-own-servers[your own servers], there is currently a different set of possible monitoring resources available. This feature gap will be gradually reduced as new releases implement the missing features on either side.



////
On both deployment scenarios, you're able to access information through the following tools:

**** link:/runtime-manager/alerts-on-runtime-manager[Alerts on Runtime Manager] – sends e-mail alerts whenever key events occur. A history of when these alerts were triggered can also be accessed.
**** link:/runtime-manager/notifications-on-runtime-manager[Notifications on Runtime Manager] – certain events can trigger notifications that are visible when clicking on the bell icon on the Anypoint Platform
////

With applications deployed to link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub[CloudHub], you can access information through the following tools:

* link:/runtime-manager/insight[Insight] – Access a dashboard with key metrics
* link:/runtime-manager/viewing-log-data[View application log data] – Access a log of events on your application
* link:/runtime-manager/worker-monitoring[Worker Monitoring] – Access information about the status of your application and the virtual server its running on
* link:/runtime-manager/alerts-and-notifications[Notifications] - Receive email alerts and notifications that can be viewed on the bell icon in the Anypoint Platform whenever key events occur


With applications deployed to link:/runtime-manager/managing-applications-on-your-own-servers[your own servers], you can access information through the following tools:

* link:/runtime-manager/sending-data-from-arm-to-external-monitoring-software[Send Data to External Monitoring Software] – Send data to an external tool like Splunk or ELK to view there
